So I had some trouble uploading to here... I uploaded my whole folder from this semmester so had to make new repository and then to make it
i had to delete those other folders and it had some of my project documents like story board and test results.
For the game to test the scoreboard if it works for you you can press shift+up_arrow when at the screen with the sprites moving arround input
scores (if logged in) and it should upload to the database.
